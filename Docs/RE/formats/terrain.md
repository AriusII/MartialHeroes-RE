## Re-verification banner (2026-06-16, CAMPAIGN 10 / Block D)

| Attribute        | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| `verification`   | `sample-verified` — `.ted` five-block layout, `.map` grammar, and the cell-streaming/decoder routing are all matched against a real VFS sample **and** the legacy loader read-path (two-witness) |
| `ida_reverified` | `2026-06-16` |
| `ida_anchor`     | `263bd994` |
| `evidence`       | `[static-ida, vfs-sample]` — loader control-flow (witness 1) + black-box census over the real `data.vfs` (witness 2) |
| `conflicts`      | None contradictory. Two precision drifts settled in the doc's favour and applied below: (1) **EXTRA_TERRAIN routes to the `.exd` 40-byte triangle decoder, not the `.ted` loader** — `.map` §3.2/§3.3 and §14(#1) flip to CONFIRMED; (2) the `.map` geometry directives `WIDTH`/`HEIGHT`/`GRID`/`MAX_HEIGHTFILED`/`MIN_HEIGHTFILED`/`ORIGIN` are **present on disk but NOT consumed by the located runtime `.map` parser** — the live 65×65 / GRID-16 grid is hard-baked in the `.ted` loader; §3.4 relabelled. New loader fact folded in: a **per-patch "steep" flag** (loader-derived, span > 8.0 world units → 1; not an on-disk field — §5.0). The block-3 texidx byte stays **stored RAW** (loader applies no `idx − 1` and no `< 1` clamp — render-domain, DBG-pending), RE-CONFIRMED at the loader store site this pass. |

**Census this pass (witness 2, full VFS mount):** `.ted` 2 505 files (all exactly 46 987 B, zero
tail) / `.map` 2 505 / `.mud` 1 578 (all exactly 32 768 B). The `.exd`/`.up` 40-byte-triangle
routing and the FX/`.bud`/`.sod` decoder routing were re-confirmed at the parser/dispatch level
(byte tables for those families hold at their committed tiers; this pass did not re-dump them — see
`terrain_layers.md` / `terrain_scene.md`).

## Status block

| Attribute          | Value |
|--------------------|-------|
| `status`           | `sample-verified` — real asset samples available and cross-checked against parser analysis |
| `sample_verified`  | `true` — confirmed with 3 `.map`, 3 `.ted`, 3 `.mud`, 3 `.bud`, 3 `.sod`, 3 `.lst`, 3 `.up`, 3 `.exd`, and `.fx1`–`.fx7` blobs |
| `binary_analysed`  | `doida.exe` (legacy 32-bit client build) |
| `confidence`       | Fields labelled CONFIRMED are corroborated by parser read-sequence and/or real sample bytes. Fields labelled VERIFIED are confirmed directly by observed sample data. PARTIAL means size or existence is confirmed but field semantics are uncertain. UNVERIFIED means inferred from call-site context only. |

**Recently promoted (2026-06-12):** The `.mud` per-tile sound-index targets (which in-memory sound
table each byte indexes), the `.ted` texture-index reference chain (block 3), the `.ted`
direction-flag bit mapping (block 4), the `.ted` diffuse alpha byte semantic (block 5), and the
full internal layout of the `.sod` 48-byte collision record (now read as four XZ corners, not a
slope-intercept line) are all sample- and read-sequence-confirmed and flipped to VERIFIED/CONFIRMED
below. See sections 5.6–5.8, 6.2 and 11.3.

**Recently promoted (2026-06-14, CAMPAIGN VFS-DEEP):** Two authoring-sidecar families that the
shipped runtime **never parses** are now explicitly documented and require **no runtime parser** —
`*.ted.post` (full drop-in `.ted`, §5.10) and the `.pre` family (`*.bud.pre`, `*.sod.pre`,
`*.fx<N>.pre` — full standalone files in their base format, §16). The `.sod` `QuadRecord` trailing
scalars at +032..+047 are **re-labelled**: they are a dead 2D edge-line cache, **not** a plane
equation (§11.3, correction below). Confidence markers preserved per source.

**Recently promoted (2026-06-15, CAMPAIGN VFS-MASTERY — two-witness gate: loader + black-box).**
Four `.ted`/`.sod` verdicts settled against two independent witnesses (the legacy loader read-path
and a black-box census of the real VFS samples): (1) the `.ted` blob is **five fixed block reads
summing 46 987 bytes with no header** — CONFIRMED across all instances (§5.1, §5.3); (2) the block-3
TextureIndexGrid `idx − 1` decrement is **real and loader-resolved** (the resolved list base is
one-decremented) — upgraded to CONFIRMED, residual closed (§5.6); (3) a block-3 byte value below 1
is **clamped up to 1** (renders slot 1) — the prior "0 = no-texture sentinel" reading is **REFUTED**;
there is no sentinel branch (§5.6, §5.9, §14); (4) the `.sod` `QuadRecord` `edge_pad0` lane at +036
is **opaque ignored padding** — no routine reads offset +036, and the ~14.6 % non-zero fraction in
the wider VFS census is **dead authoring residue**, loader-resolved (§11.3, §14). Confidence markers
updated per finding below.

**Reconciliation correction (2026-06-16, CAMPAIGN VFS-MASTERY-B — two-witness reconcile).** A fresh
reconcile pass (loader read-path witness + black-box VFS census over all 2 505 `.ted` instances)
**revises** the block-3 TextureIndexGrid verdict above: the loader stores the texture-index byte
**RAW** — it applies **no** `idx − 1` decrement and **no** value-below-1 clamp. Both the `idx − 1`
resolution and the value-0 → 1 floor occur **downstream of the parse**, where the resolved texture
is finalized — **not** in the `.ted` loader; a faithful **parser** must store the raw block-3 byte
and must NOT decrement or clamp — see §5.6, §5.9, §14. The five-block 46 987-byte layout (item 1) and
the `.sod` `edge_pad0` padding (item 4) are unaffected.

**CORRECTED CYCLE 1 (2026-06-19, ida_anchor 263bd994, evidence [static-ida]) — the `idx − 1`
decrement is RESOLVED.** The earlier "DBG-pending render-path site" for the decrement/clamp is now
**statically resolved** and is no longer debugger-pending. The `idx − 1` decrement is a **real,
fixed, statically isolable code site in the map/cell-descriptor finalize path** — the **per-cell
texture finalize routine** (a 16×16 = 256-cell loop). It applies **only** to the `.ted` per-cell
texture-index byte: each cell's byte is first **clamped to `[1, count]`** (both `< 1` and `> count`
→ 1), then resolved as `perCellTexList[byte − 1]`. The `− 1` is purely the difference between the
resolve base and the write base (the list is written from one slot higher than it is read), with the
clamped index ranging `1..count` — it is constant-folded into a fixed base displacement, so no live
frame is needed to observe it. The raw `.map` `intTexId` is stored into the per-cell list **without**
any `− 1`, and the global texture-pool accessors index `pool_base + 76 · intTexId` **directly,
without** any `− 1`. So the `.ted` index byte is the **only** `− 1` in the entire chain. This
retires every prior "OPEN / DBG-pending decrement-site" note. (See `bgtexture_lst.md §Cross-file
join`, which encodes the same resolution.)

## Overview

The terrain system organises the game world as a uniform grid of **cells**, each covering exactly
1024 × 1024 world units. Cells are identified by a `(mapX, mapZ)` integer coordinate pair biased
around the world origin at `(10000, 10000)`, so the cell whose south-west corner aligns with
world-space `(0, 0)` has coordinates `mapX = 10000, mapZ = 10000`.

At runtime a ring of cells is kept loaded around the player position, driven by a background
thread. Each cell is described by three files sharing a common base path:

| Extension | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `.mud`    | Headerless binary blob; ambient-sound tile grid (internal layout CONFIRMED — see section 6) |
| `.gad`    | Purpose UNKNOWN — loader is a no-op stub |
| `.map`    | Plain-text ASCII scene descriptor; references per-cell binary asset blobs |

Binary assets referenced from within `.map` include:

| Extension | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `.ted`    | Terrain geometry blob: heightmap, normals, colour, lookup tables |
| `.bud`    | Building mesh blob: static building and prop geometry |
| `.up`     | Upper-terrain geometry blob: overlay/bridge triangle list |
| `.exd`    | Extended-detail / extra-terrain blob: same binary structure as `.up`; referenced by the `EXTRA_TERRAIN` section (RESOLVED 2026-06-16 — §3.3) |
| `.fx1`–`.fx7` | Special-effect layer blobs (7 named slots) |
| `.sod`    | Collision solid geometry |

Two further per-cell file families are present in the VFS but are **authoring/editor sidecars that
the shipped runtime never opens**: `*.ted.post` and the `.pre` family (`*.bud.pre`, `*.sod.pre`,
`*.fx<N>.pre`). They are documented for preservation/tooling only — see §5.10 and §16. **An engineer
implementing `Assets.Parsers` needs no parser for either family.**

A separate per-area cell manifest (`.lst`) and a global background-texture list (`bgtexture.lst`)
are loaded at area-switch time, outside the per-cell path.

---

## 1. Area and cell naming

### 1.1 Area identifier

A map area is identified by an integer `areaId`. Its three decimal digits are separated as:

```
d0 = areaId / 100
d1 = (areaId / 10) % 10
d2 = areaId % 10
```

The directory root for an area is:

```
data/map<d0><d1><d2>/
```

### 1.2 Per-area cell manifest — `.lst`

**Path pattern:** `data/map<d0><d1><d2>/dat/d<d0><d1><d2>.lst`

The manifest is a compact binary file that lists the valid `(mapX, mapZ)` pairs for an area.
A cell coordinate pair that does not appear in this manifest is never loaded, regardless of
proximity to the player.

**Binary layout** (CONFIRMED — verified against 3 sample files; no magic or version prefix):

| Offset | Size        | Type      | Field   | Notes                                     | Confidence |
|-------:|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| 0      | 4           | u32le     | `count` | Number of valid cell entries              | CONFIRMED  |
| 4      | `count × 4` | u32le[]   | `keys`  | One cell key per entry; see formula below | CONFIRMED  |

Cell key formula:

```
key = mapZ + 100000 × mapX
```

Verified: file size is exactly `4 + count × 4` bytes with no header prefix. The three samples
(1-entry 8-byte files and a 2-entry 12-byte file) all match this formula exactly.

**Known unknowns:** None outstanding — the three sample files are fully accounted for.

### 1.3 Per-cell base path

For cell `(mapX, mapZ)` in area `areaId`:

```
data/map<d0><d1><d2>/dat/d<d0><d1><d2>x<mapX>z<mapZ>
```

The three fixed per-cell files are formed by appending `.mud`, `.gad`, and `.map` to this base
path. Additional blobs (`.ted`, `.bud`, `.up`, `.sod`, etc.) are referenced by path from within
the `.map` file.

### 1.4 Per-cell world-space bounds

The world-space bounding rectangle of a cell is derived from its grid coordinates:

```
worldX_min = (mapX - 10000) × 1024.0
worldZ_min = (mapZ - 10000) × 1024.0
worldX_max = worldX_min + 1024.0
worldZ_max = worldZ_min + 1024.0
```

The subtraction of 10000 is the world-origin bias. One cell covers exactly **1024 × 1024 world
units**. The mapping of "world units" to metres or any other physical scale is UNVERIFIED.

---

## 2. World-position to cell coordinate mapping

Given a player world position `(worldX, worldZ)`, the corresponding cell coordinates are:

```
If worldX < 0: adjusted_X = worldX - 1024.0   else: adjusted_X = worldX
If worldZ < 0: adjusted_Z = worldZ - 1024.0   else: adjusted_Z = worldZ

cellX_raw = floor(adjusted_X × (1 / 1024.0))
cellZ_raw = floor(adjusted_Z × (1 / 1024.0))

mapX = cellX_raw + 10000
mapZ = cellZ_raw + 10000
```

The multiplier `1 / 1024.0 = 0.0009765625` is CONFIRMED. The negative-axis correction
(subtract 1024 before truncation) ensures floor-division semantics for negative world
coordinates.

---

## 3. The `.map` scene descriptor (text format)

The `.map` file is a **plain ASCII text** file with CRLF line endings (`0x0D 0x0A`) and TAB
indentation (`0x09`). It contains no binary bytes.

### 3.1 Grammar

```
<mapfile>   ::= <section>*
<section>   ::= <sectionKW> '{' <directive>* '}'
<directive> ::= 'WIDTH'           <integer>
              | 'HEIGHT'          <integer>
              | 'GRID'            <integer>
              | 'MAX_HEIGHTFILED' <float>
              | 'MIN_HEIGHTFILED' <float>
              | 'ORIGIN'          <float> ',' <float>
              | 'DATAFILE'        <vfsPath>
              | 'TEXTURES'        '{' <texEntry>* '}'
<texEntry>  ::= <intFlag> <intTexId> ['"' <devPath> '"']
<sectionKW> ::= 'TERRAIN' | 'EXTRA_TERRAIN' | 'UP_TERRAIN' | 'BUILDING'
              | 'FX1' | 'FX2' | 'FX3' | 'FX4' | 'FX5' | 'FX6' | 'FX7'
              | 'SOLID'
```

All 12 section keywords are CONFIRMED in the parser and samples. Lines where the first
non-whitespace character is `#` are comments and are ignored.

### 3.2 Sections and `DATAFILE` targets

Each section contains a `DATAFILE` directive that supplies the VFS-relative path to the
associated binary blob. The sub-loader is selected by section keyword, not by file extension.

**Decoder routing is proven from the located runtime `.map` parser (reconfirmed 2026-06-16):** each
section keyword string-matches to exactly one decoder, by keyword (not by file extension).

| Section keyword  | Binary blob extension | Decoder called (role)                           | Confidence |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `TERRAIN`        | `.ted`                | `.ted` five-block loader — primary tile geometry | CONFIRMED (parser + samples) |
| `EXTRA_TERRAIN`  | `.exd`                | The `.exd`/`.up` 40-byte-triangle decoder (NOT the `.ted` loader) — secondary triangle geometry | CONFIRMED (parser; RESOLVED 2026-06-16 — see §3.3) |
| `UP_TERRAIN`     | `.up`                 | The `.up`/`.exd` 40-byte-triangle decoder — upper/overlay triangle geometry | CONFIRMED (parser + samples) |
| `BUILDING`       | `.bud`                | `.bud` building-mesh loader — static building and prop geometry | CONFIRMED (parser + samples) |
| `FX1`–`FX7`      | `.fx1`–`.fx7`         | Seven per-channel `.fx<N>` group-array decoders — special-effect layers | CONFIRMED (parser + samples) |
| `SOLID`          | `.sod`                | `.sod` collision loader — collision geometry    | CONFIRMED (parser + samples) |

**Routing note (reconfirmed two-witness 2026-06-16):** `EXTRA_TERRAIN` and `UP_TERRAIN` both decode
through the **40-byte triangle** record format (`.exd` and `.up` respectively share one record
decoder, §9), structurally **distinct** from both the `TERRAIN` `.ted` five-block format and the FX
group-array format. There are **two byte-identical `.map` parsers** in the client — a VFS-path parser
and a loose-disk twin — with the same control flow and the same decoder dispatch; a faithful port
needs only one.

**`DATAFILE` always names a BASE extension.** Every `DATAFILE` line observed names a base asset
path (`… .bud`, `… .ted`, `… .sod`, `… .fx<N>`, `… .up`) — **never** a `.pre` or a `.post` variant.
The runtime VFS open router resolves the literal path with no extension rewriting, fallback, or
base/pre/post selection logic, so the authoring sidecars are unreachable from any runtime load
path (see §5.10, §16). CONFIRMED.

### 3.3 EXTRA_TERRAIN and `.exd` blobs — RESOLVED (EXTRA_TERRAIN → `.exd`)

**RESOLVED (2026-06-16, two-witness).** `EXTRA_TERRAIN` targets the `.exd` blob, decoded by the
**40-byte-triangle decoder** (the same record decoder shared with `.up`, §9) — **not** the `.ted`
five-block loader. The earlier "plausible but UNVERIFIED" reading is now CONFIRMED.

Witness 1 (loader read-path) settles it directly: in the located runtime `.map` parser, the
`EXTRA_TERRAIN` block's `DATAFILE` is dispatched to the `.exd`/`.up` triangle decoder, while the
`TERRAIN` block's `DATAFILE` is dispatched to the `.ted` five-block loader. The two decoders are
distinct functions targeting distinct on-disk formats.

The reason a sample-only pass could never settle this: the available `.map` samples carry an
**empty** `EXTRA_TERRAIN` block (no `DATAFILE` line), so no sample alone exercised the route; the
parser's keyword→decoder dispatch is what proves it. Sample `.exd` files share their cell
coordinates with these cells and their binary structure is the `.up` triangle layout (triangle-count
prefix + 40-byte triangle records — §9), consistent with the routing. CONFIRMED.

### 3.4 Geometry directives (TERRAIN section) — present on disk, NOT consumed by the runtime `.map` parser

These directives appear inside `TERRAIN {}` blocks. **Confidence relabel (2026-06-16, two-witness).**
The earlier "CONFIRMED (parser + samples)" overstated the parser's role: the located runtime `.map`
parser does **not** consume any of these directives — it string-matches only the section keywords,
`DATAFILE`, and `TEXTURES`, and skips `WIDTH`/`HEIGHT`/`GRID`/`MAX_HEIGHTFILED`/`MIN_HEIGHTFILED`/
`ORIGIN` as generic tokens. They ARE present and well-formed on disk (witness 2), and their values
are authoritative because the **live grid is hard-baked in the `.ted` loader** (65 × 65 vertices,
64 × 64 quads, 16-unit spacing — §5.1/§5.2). So the values are right, but they are `.ted`-derived /
informational on-disk echoes, **not** parser inputs.

| Directive         | Type    | Sample value  | Semantics                              | Confidence |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| `WIDTH`           | integer | `64`          | Quad grid width (quads per row)        | sample-verified (present on disk); value confirmed in the `.ted` loader; NOT read by the `.map` parser |
| `HEIGHT`          | integer | `64`          | Quad grid height (quads per column)    | sample-verified (present on disk); value confirmed in the `.ted` loader; NOT read by the `.map` parser |
| `GRID`            | integer | `16`          | World-unit spacing between vertices    | sample-verified (present on disk); value confirmed in the `.ted` loader; NOT read by the `.map` parser |
| `MAX_HEIGHTFILED` | float   | e.g. `266.053680` | Maximum world-Y in this cell; informational only | sample-verified (present on disk); NOT read by the `.map` parser |
| `MIN_HEIGHTFILED` | float   | e.g. `1.276898`   | Minimum world-Y in this cell; informational only | sample-verified (present on disk); NOT read by the `.map` parser |
| `ORIGIN`          | float, float | e.g. `0.000, -10240.000` | World-space XZ origin of the quad, comma-separated; equals `(mapX-10000)*1024, (mapZ-10000)*1024` (e.g. a `z9990` cell has Z origin `(9990−10000)·1024 = −10240.000`) | sample-verified (present on disk); NOT read by the `.map` parser |

**Note:** `MAX_HEIGHTFILED` and `MIN_HEIGHTFILED` are verbatim keywords in the original data
files, preserving the dropped-L spelling; an implementation must match this exact spelling.

**Implementor guidance:** do not rely on these directives at parse time — the runtime does not. An
engineer hard-codes the 65 × 65 / GRID-16 grid (§5.1) and derives the cell origin from `(mapX, mapZ)`
(§1.4), exactly as the `.ted` loader does. (Open sub-question — [static-hypothesis]: whether any
non-runtime tools/editor path reads these directives; none found in the located runtime parser.)

### 3.5 `TEXTURES` directive

```
TEXTURES
{
    <intFlag>  <intTexId>  "<devPath>"
    ...
}
```

Each entry is a pair of integers followed by an optional quoted development path. Parse logic:

1. Read the next whitespace-delimited token. If it parses as an integer greater than zero, it is
   `intFlag` (consumed and discarded — semantics unknown, always `1` in samples).
2. Read the following token as `intTexId` (integer). Call the section's `setTextureId(intTexId)`.
3. The quoted `"devPath"` token (a development-machine source path) is read by the tokenizer
   and silently ignored at runtime.
4. If the token from step 1 parses as zero or less, check for `}` to close the block.

| Field      | Type    | Sample value             | Semantics                                    | Confidence |
|------------|---------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| `intFlag`  | integer | `1`                      | Read and discarded; purpose UNVERIFIED       | CONFIRMED (read); UNVERIFIED (semantics) |
| `intTexId` | integer | e.g. `155`               | Index into the `bgtexture.lst` global pool   | CONFIRMED  |
| `devPath`  | string  | `"d:/do_project/..."` | Development source path; runtime-ignored     | CONFIRMED (present; not loaded) |

Texture table capacity per section type:

| Section type          | Maximum entries |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `TERRAIN`/`TileTerrain` | UNVERIFIED    |
| `UP_TERRAIN`/`MassTerrain` | 128        | CONFIRMED |
| `FX1`–`FX7`           | 32 per slot     | CONFIRMED |

**Resolution is by LIST POSITION, not by the slot integer (reconfirmed 2026-06-16, two-witness).**
Within each section block the parser appends one entry per `TEXTURES{}` line, in file order, building
a 0-based per-section list. A tile/object selector (the `.ted` block-3 byte, the `.bud` `tex_id`)
indexes this list **by its registration position**; the leading slot integer on each `TEXTURES` line
is read and **discarded** (it does not key the lookup). The per-section list caps at **128** entries.
`EXTRA_TERRAIN` and `UP_TERRAIN` are **first-class `.map` section blocks** with their own `DATAFILE`
and `TEXTURES{}` lists, parsed by the same block parser as `TERRAIN`/`BUILDING` (§3.1, §3.2).
CONFIRMED.

## 4. Background texture list — `bgtexture.lst`

**Path:** `data/map000/texture/bgtexture.lst`

This file is loaded once at startup for area 000 and is not reloaded per-cell. It populates
a global pool of background textures that all terrain sections reference by index.

Texture asset path format (CONFIRMED):

```
data/map000/texture/<name>.dds
```

### 4.1 Binary layout

| Offset | Size              | Type      | Field        | Notes                                       | Confidence |
|-------:|------------------:|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| 0      | 4                 | u32le     | `texCount`   | Number of background texture entries; valid range 1–1999 | CONFIRMED |
| 4      | `texCount × 1`    | u8[]      | `typeBytes`  | One type byte per entry; `1` = animated, `≥ 2` = static | UNVERIFIED (semantics) |
| 4 + `texCount` | `texCount × 76` | record[] | `texRecords` | One 76-byte GHTex record per entry | UNVERIFIED |

**Known unknowns:** The internal layout of each 76-byte GHTex record is not yet documented.
Only the stride (76 bytes) and the type-byte conditional are inferred from loader logic.

### 4.2 Text companion — `bgtexture.txt`

**Path:** `data/map000/texture/bgtexture.txt` (a `bgtexture.txt` sits beside every `bgtexture.lst`).

A plain-text (CP949) companion to the binary `.lst` that lists the same pool in human-readable
form. Each line is TAB-separated with three columns (observed from sample — CONFIRMED against the
shipped file and cross-checked: every resolved path exists in the VFS):

```
<poolIndex:int>  \t  <typeFlag:int>  \t  <relPath>
0	1	terrain/a-b-1
116	1	terrain/g3
```

| Column | Meaning |
|-------:|---------|
| 0 | 0-based pool index (same index the `.map` `TEXTURES{}` `intTexId` references) |
| 1 | type flag (`1` = animated, observed; matches the `.lst` `typeBytes`) |
| 2 | texture path **relative to** `data/map{area}/texture/`, **without** the `.dds` extension (e.g. `terrain/g3` → `data/map000/texture/terrain/g3.dds`; building textures use the `building/<name>` prefix) |

The line count equals `texCount + 1` (header-less; index column is contiguous 0..texCount-1).
This text companion is the preferred, robust source for the index→filename mapping (the binary
GHTex record layout in §4.1 remains UNVERIFIED). Confidence: CONFIRMED (observed).

**Full terrain texture resolution chain (CONFIRMED, observed on cell `d000x10000z9990`):**

```
.ted TextureIndexGrid[patch]  (1-based byte, e.g. 1)
  -> .map  TERRAIN{} TEXTURES[byte-1].intTexId   (e.g. 116)
  -> bgtexture.txt[intTexId]  relPath            (e.g. "terrain/g3")
  -> data/map000/texture/<relPath>.dds           (exists)
```

Building (`.bud`) object textures resolve identically but through the `.map` `BUILDING{}`
`TEXTURES` list: BUD `tex_id` (1-based) → `BUILDING TEXTURES[tex_id-1].intTexId` → pool → `.dds`.

## 5. Terrain geometry blob — `.ted`

The `.ted` blob is the binary payload referenced by `DATAFILE` inside a `TERRAIN`,
`EXTRA_TERRAIN`, or `UP_TERRAIN` section. It has **no file header**: offset 0 of the file is
always the first height value of the heightmap. This is CONFIRMED — the loader issues its first
read at file offset 0 with no preceding header read, and all three sample files begin with valid
IEEE 754 height values at byte 0. The loader consumes the file as **exactly five fixed-size block
reads with no header, no version prefix, and no inter-block padding** (§5.3); the five block sizes
sum to a constant 46 987 bytes — CONFIRMED across every observed instance (two-witness:
loader read-path + black-box VFS census).

An editor-only sidecar named `*.ted.post` shares this exact layout but is never read by the
runtime — see §5.10.

### 5.0 Loader-derived per-patch "steep" flag (runtime state, NOT an on-disk field)

After reading the five blocks, the loader runs the 16 × 16 patch-build pass (§5.2) and, for each
patch, computes the patch's height span (max patch height − min patch height). **If that span
exceeds 8.0 world units, the loader sets a per-patch byte flag to 1** in the in-memory patch record.
This is a runtime-derived steepness/slope marker (threshold 8.0), **not** a field stored in the
`.ted` file — it does not change the on-disk format. It is recorded here because a faithful port
that re-derives per-patch state may want to reproduce the same marker. CONFIRMED (loader).

Both this steep flag and the `.mud` per-tile audio indices live in the in-memory cell/patch record
alongside the stored block-3 texture-index byte and the block-4 direction byte; only the texture-index
and direction bytes come from the `.ted` file (blocks 3 and 4).

### 5.1 Grid geometry

| Property          | Value                     | Confidence |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Vertex grid       | 65 × 65 vertices          | CONFIRMED  |
| Quad grid         | 64 × 64 quads per cell    | CONFIRMED  |
| Vertex spacing    | 16.0 world units          | CONFIRMED (derived: 1024 / 64 = 16; literal constant in loader) |
| Total file size   | 46 987 bytes (0xB78B)     | CONFIRMED (five fixed block reads summing to 46 987 B, no header; **exactly 46 987 B on all 2 505 `.ted` instances** in the VFS census — two-witness: loader + black-box) |

### 5.2 Axis orientation — `heights[row * 65 + col]`, X = column

Rows are constant-Z slices; columns are constant-X slices. The grid is **row-major with X as the
inner (fast, stride-1) axis and Z as the outer (slow, stride-65) axis**:

```
heights[row * 65 + col]
  col = X axis (INNER / fast, stride 1):  col 0 = cell X minimum (western edge),  col 64 = cell X maximum (eastern edge)
  row = Z axis (OUTER / slow, stride 65): row 0 = cell Z minimum (southern edge), row 64 = cell Z maximum (northern edge)
```

**Confidence: PARSER-VERIFIED (CONFIRMED).** Two independent lines of evidence agree, so there is
**no residual** on the axis:

1. **Loader index arithmetic.** The terrain loader builds the per-cell vertex grid in the same pass
   that reads the five blocks. Its mesh-build nested loops compute each vertex's linear height index
   as `row * 65 + col`, where the contiguous unit-stride term increments per inner step and the
   `+65` term accumulates per outer step (grid width 65). The same two loop dimensions stamp the
   per-vertex world coordinates against the cell-origin bases (cell-X base `(mapX - 10000) * 1024`,
   cell-Z base `(mapZ - 10000) * 1024`): **world X is driven by the unit-stride (column) dimension**
   and **world Z by the stride-65 (row) dimension**. This fixes column -> world X and row -> world Z
   directly from the loader, independent of any sample test.
2. **Seam-continuity sample test.** Between two Z-adjacent cells the last row (index 64) of the
   lower-Z cell matches the first row (index 0) of the higher-Z cell within float rounding noise --
   consistent with row = Z.

This upgrades the earlier sample-only/UNVERIFIED reading of the grid orientation to parser-verified.
A converter (e.g. the terrain -> glTF mapper in `Assets.Mapping`) may treat `heights[row * 65 + col]`
with X = column / Z = row as settled and drop any "axis unverified" caveat.

All five data blocks (heightmap, normals, texture-index 16x16, direction 16x16, diffuse) use this
same row-major, Z-as-row, X-as-column convention -- the loader addresses every block with the same
`row * 65 + col` (or the matching `/4` patch-grid) arithmetic.

### 5.3 Sequential block layout

The file is read as five contiguous fixed-size blocks with no padding or alignment between them.
The reader issues **five fixed block reads and nothing else** — no header, no count fields, no
inter-block seek — so the five sizes below sum to the constant 46 987-byte file. Client error
strings name four of the five blocks directly.

| Block | Byte offset | Size (bytes) | Hex size | Client name / evidence         | Element type | Elements    | Confidence |
|------:|------------:|-------------:|----------|--------------------------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1     | 0           | 16 900       | 0x4204   | `height_map` (error string)    | f32le        | 65 × 65 = 4 225 | CONFIRMED |
| 2     | 16 900      | 12 675       | 0x3183   | `normal_map` (error string)    | i8 × 3      | 65 × 65 = 4 225 | CONFIRMED |
| 3     | 29 575      | 256          | 0x100    | texture index (unnamed)        | u8           | 256         | CONFIRMED |
| 4     | 29 831      | 256          | 0x100    | `direction_map` (error string) | u8           | 256         | CONFIRMED |
| 5     | 30 087      | 16 900       | 0x4204   | `diffuse_map` (error string)   | u8 × 4      | 65 × 65 = 4 225 | CONFIRMED |

Sum check: `16900 + 12675 + 256 + 256 + 16900 = 46987` bytes — equals the fixed file size with zero
remainder (CONFIRMED). Block 5 offset 30 087 is independently confirmed by the editor writer, which
seeks explicitly to that offset before patching the diffuse block.

**RE-CONFIRMED (2026-06-16, two-witness, anchor 263bd994):** the loader issues the file-open call
then exactly **five fixed-size reads and nothing else** — no header read, no seek between reads, no
count fields — and the five reads land in five distinct scratch buffers (one per block). Witness 2:
all 2 505 `.ted` files in the VFS are exactly 46 987 bytes with zero tail. Four of the five blocks
are named by client error strings (`height_map`, `normal_map`, `direction map`, `diffuse map`);
block 3 (texture index) has no error string. No drift from this layout.

### 5.4 Block 1 — Heightmap

- 4 225 IEEE 754 single-precision floats, little-endian, stored in row-major order (see §5.2).
- Values are **direct world-space Y coordinates** (no scale multiplier). CONFIRMED — the loader
  applies no scale to the f32 values; the only related constant is 16.0 (the XZ vertex spacing).
- Sample observed height ranges: flat sea tiles hold a constant value near +26 world units;
  hilly tiles span approximately −160 to +380 world units.

### 5.5 Block 2 — Vertex normals

- 4 225 packed RGB triples, one per vertex, same row-major order as block 1.
- **Encoding:** each component is a signed byte (i8); decode as `N_component = (i8)byte / 127.0`.
  The divisor 127.0 is a literal constant in the loader. The loader sign-extends each byte before
  dividing, confirming signed input. CONFIRMED.
- **Channel order:** R = Nx, G = Ny (vertical/up), B = Nz.
- **Verification:** a flat horizontal tile (all heights equal) yields all normals (0, 127, 0),
  which decodes to (0.0, 1.0, 0.0) — a perfect Y-up unit vector. Hilly-tile normals decode to
  near-unit vectors aligned with the computed surface slope.
- **Axis convention:** normals are in world space. The Y axis is vertical-up. Terrain normals
  always point upward, so the G channel (Ny) is always in the range 0–127; R and B span −128..+127.

### 5.6 Block 3 — Texture index grid

- 256 unsigned bytes forming a **16 × 16 grid** (same row=Z, col=X convention; 4 × 4 quad region
  per entry, since 64 / 16 = 4 quads per axis per entry).
- Values are **1-based** (no zero observed in any sample; maximum observed is 11).
- The `.map` `GRID 16` directive matches this 16 × 16 subdivision factor exactly.
- **Semantic:** each byte selects the background texture for the corresponding 4 × 4 quad region.
  The value is a **1-based position into the per-cell texture list** that the section builds from
  the `.map` file's `TEXTURES {}` block, and that list in turn holds indices into the global
  `bgtexture.lst` pool. The full resolution chain is therefore two hops:

  ```
  texture_index_byte (1-based)
    -> per_cell_texture_list[byte - 1]   (built from the .map TEXTURES{} entries, capacity 128)
    -> bgtexture.lst[pool_slot]          (global texture pool loaded at startup)
  ```

  CONFIRMED: the loader stashes each registered texture into the section's per-cell array as the
  `.map` is parsed (one entry appended per `TEXTURES{}` line, in file order, starting at slot 0),
  and stores this block-3 byte alongside each tile for later lookup against that array. The two-hop
  resolution (per-cell list, then global pool) is confirmed; the per-cell list caps at 128 entries.
  Sample `d036` exercises values 1..11 across distinct texture zones; `d000` uses only value 1.
- **The decrement is `[byte - 1]` (idx-1), applied in the RENDER domain — NOT by the `.ted` loader
  (corrected 2026-06-16).** The on-disk block-3 byte is **1-based** (never 0 in any sample, max
  observed 11) while the per-cell texture list is **0-based, registration-order** (first registered
  texture at slot 0). The `.ted` loader stores this byte **RAW** — it does **not** subtract one. The
  `- 1` is applied later, where the resolved texture is selected for binding at draw time, so the
  rendered tile uses `per_cell_texture_list[byte - 1]`. This matches the BUILDING object path
  (`BUILDING TEXTURES[tex_id - 1]`, §4.2): the building `tex_id` is likewise a 1-based index into its
  own per-section registration-order list, with the identical `- 1` applied at resolution. **A faithful
  `.ted` parser must store the raw block-3 byte and must NOT decrement it**; the decrement belongs to
  the render/texture-resolution layer (`Assets.Mapping` / the renderer), not `Assets.Parsers`. The
  render-time outcome (`texlist[byte - 1]`) is settled by two witnesses, and the decrement site is
  now **statically RESOLVED** (CYCLE 1): the `- 1` is applied in the **per-cell texture finalize
  routine** of the map/cell-descriptor finalize path — a fixed, isolable code site, not a live-frame
  artifact. Confidence: CONFIRMED (render outcome) / CONFIRMED (finalize-site decrement — not `.ted`
  loader behaviour).
  **RE-CONFIRMED at the loader store site (2026-06-16, anchor 263bd994):** the `.ted` loader copies
  the block-3 byte **verbatim** into the in-memory patch record — there is no decrement and no clamp
  at the store. This corroborates the split: the `.ted` loader stores raw; the **finalize routine**
  (not a draw-time render path) applies the `- 1` and the `[1, count]` clamp once, while resolving
  the per-cell texture list. **CORRECTED CYCLE 1:** the `- 1` is on the `.ted` byte ONLY (clamp
  `[1, count]`); the `.map` `intTexId` is stored raw and the global pool accessors apply no `- 1`.
- **Value 0 — clamp-to-1, NOT a sentinel (REFUTED); clamp is RENDER-domain (corrected 2026-06-16).**
  No sample tile carries value 0, but a 0 (or any value below 1) is **clamped up to 1** at the render
  path (`if byte < 1: byte = 1`) and therefore renders texture slot 1 — it does **not** select a
  no-texture / fallback path. The earlier reading that "0 = a no-texture / fallback sentinel" is
  **REFUTED**: there is no sentinel branch; an out-of-range low byte is silently floored to the first
  texture. **The `.ted` loader does NOT perform this clamp** — it stores the raw byte; the floor-to-1
  is applied where the texture is resolved for binding, alongside the `- 1` decrement above. A faithful
  **parser** stores the raw block-3 byte; the **finalize routine** treats any byte `< 1` as 1 (and any
  byte `> count` as 1) before applying the `- 1`, so a 0 byte resolves to `texlist[0]` (the first
  registered texture). Confidence: CONFIRMED (render outcome) / CONFIRMED (clamp `[1, count]` at the
  finalize site — not `.ted` loader behaviour; statically RESOLVED CYCLE 1).

### 5.7 Block 4 — Quad split / UV orientation flags

- 256 unsigned bytes forming a **16 × 16 grid**, same coverage as block 3 (one byte per 4 × 4 quad
  patch).
- Only the two least-significant bits are used; observed values are 0, 1, 2, 3 only.
- **Bit-to-axis mapping** (CONFIRMED from the UV-generation path):

  | Mask  | Name     | Effect when set                                              |
  |-------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `0x01`| `s_flip` | Mirror the S (horizontal, U) texture coordinate of the patch |
  | `0x02`| `t_flip` | Mirror the T (vertical, V) texture coordinate of the patch  |

- **UV generation:** within each patch the loader walks the 5 × 5 vertices and assigns a UV
  fraction `f = vertex_offset × 0.25` (stepping 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). When `s_flip` is set,
  the S coordinate becomes `1.0 − f`; otherwise it is `f`. The same rule applies to T using
  `t_flip`. The four bit combinations therefore are:

  | Value | S axis            | T axis            |
  |-------|-------------------|-------------------|
  | `0b00`| forward           | forward           |
  | `0b01`| mirrored          | forward           |
  | `0b10`| forward           | mirrored          |
  | `0b11`| mirrored          | mirrored          |

- **Diagonal note:** because the texture seam follows the UV orientation, the flip combination also
  determines the visual diagonal of the two-triangle quad split when the patch is rendered. The
  client error string names this block "direction map". The S/T flip mapping is CONFIRMED; whether
  a specific combination additionally re-selects the triangulation diagonal versus only re-orienting
  the texture is PARTIAL.

### 5.8 Block 5 — Per-vertex diffuse colour

- 4 225 four-byte RGBA quads, one per vertex, same row-major order as block 1.
- **Channel order: R at +0, G at +1, B at +2, A at +3** (RGBA, not ARGB). CONFIRMED — the editor
  write path fills the three colour bytes individually at those aligned offsets.
- All three available samples contain exclusively `(R=255, G=255, B=255, A=0)` across all
  vertices — the default unset (pure-white) state.
- **Alpha byte (+3):** the A byte is **0x00 in every sampled vertex and is never read by the
  runtime loader**. It is alignment padding emitted by the editor to keep each pixel 4-byte aligned,
  not a meaningful channel. CONFIRMED (zero across all samples; no runtime read path consumes it).
  Any modern re-encoder should write A as 0 and must not depend on it.
- **On-disk 2× / load-time 0.5× encoding:** the editor doubles each colour byte on write
  (`stored = 2 × source`) and the loader halves it on read (`output = stored × 0.5`), so the
  round-trip is identity. The runtime halving deliberately leaves brightness headroom so that
  dynamic lighting can add up to full white at draw time. This scaling is code-confirmed; it is not
  independently sample-verified because all available samples are uniform white, where the 2×
  relationship is unobservable (255 is not exactly 2 × any stored byte). Treat the 2× factor as
  CONFIRMED-by-code / PARTIAL-by-sample.

### 5.9 Known unknowns

- Block 3 reference target: RESOLVED — the 1-based byte indexes the per-cell `TEXTURES{}` list,
  which itself indexes the global `bgtexture.lst` pool (§5.6). **Loader vs finalize domain (RESOLVED
  CYCLE 1):** the `.ted` loader stores the byte RAW; the `idx − 1` decrement and the `[1, count]`
  clamp are applied once by the **per-cell texture finalize routine** (a fixed, statically isolable
  code site in the map/cell-descriptor finalize path — no longer DBG-pending). The outcome is settled
  (tile uses `texlist[byte − 1]`; a byte `< 1` or `> count` floors to slot 1; NOT a no-texture
  sentinel — that reading is REFUTED). The `− 1` is on the `.ted` byte ONLY; the `.map` `intTexId` is
  stored raw and the pool accessors apply no `− 1`. No open sub-question remains for the decrement site.
- Block 4 flag mapping: RESOLVED for texture orientation — bit `0x01` mirrors S (U), bit `0x02`
  mirrors T (V) (§5.7). Open (PARTIAL): whether a flip combination also re-selects the quad
  triangulation diagonal rather than only re-orienting the texture.
- Block 5 alpha: RESOLVED — the A byte is alignment padding, always 0, never read (§5.8). The 2×
  store / 0.5× load scaling is code-confirmed but stays sample-unverified until a tinted (non-white)
  tile is captured.
- World-unit-to-physical-scale relationship (1024 wu per cell = ? metres).

### 5.10 Editor sidecar — `*.ted.post` (runtime never reads)

**Path pattern:** `data/map<NNN>/dat/d<NNN>x<mapX>z<mapZ>.ted.post`

A `*.ted.post` file is a **full, drop-in copy of its companion `.ted` cell** in the identical
46 987-byte five-block layout — there is **no wrapper header, no version prefix, and no delta/patch
framing**. Offset 0 is the first heightmap float, exactly as in a base `.ted`. The `.post` suffix
marks a workspace copy written by the in-game terrain editor when it saves a patched cell.

- **The shipped runtime never loads `*.ted.post`.** The `.map` `DATAFILE` line always names the base
  `.ted` (§3.2), and the VFS open router performs no extension fallback, so this sidecar sits off
  every runtime load path. CONFIRMED.
- **An engineer needs no parser for this format.** If a preservation tool ever wishes to read one,
  it parses byte-for-byte as the `.ted` blocks documented in §5.3–§5.8 — no other handling.

| Property                        | Value / finding | Confidence |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| On-disk layout                  | Identical to base `.ted` (five blocks, no prefix) | HIGH (head/mid/tail windows compared byte-for-byte across map016/map046/map038 pairs) |
| Fixed file size                 | 46 987 bytes    | HIGH (all 852 VFS instances are exactly this size) |
| Wrapper / patch header          | None — data starts at offset 0 | HIGH |
| Count in VFS                    | 852 files; base extension is `.ted` only (every entry is `*.ted.post`) | HIGH |
| Affected areas                  | 23 areas (map016 and above); absent in map001–map015 | HIGH |
| Read by runtime                 | No                | HIGH (runtime reads only `.ted`; corroborated by the loader analysis behind §3.2) |

**Known unknowns (sidecar):**

- **Content divergence:** every sampled `.post` is byte-for-byte identical to its companion `.ted`,
  so it is UNVERIFIED whether any `.post` in this VFS snapshot ever holds different terrain data
  (the editor may copy then patch, or the snapshot predates any edit). This does not affect the
  format verdict — the layout is identical regardless.
- **Editor save protocol** (write-then-rename vs. staging copy) is not recoverable from VFS content
  alone; the "post" = post-edit naming is a reasonable inference, marked UNVERIFIED.

## 6. Ambient-sound tile blob — `.mud`

The `.mud` file is a **headerless fixed-size binary blob** of exactly **32 768 bytes (0x8000)**.
There is no magic number, version field, or length prefix. The file is loaded in a single read
call. Its sole consumer at runtime is the sound manager, which uses it to select music and ambient
sound indices for the player's current position. It has no relation to collision or walkability.

### 6.1 Grid dimensions

| Property                  | Value                   | Confidence |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Grid columns (X axis)     | 64                      | CONFIRMED  |
| Grid rows (Z axis)        | 64                      | CONFIRMED  |
| Record stride             | 8 bytes                 | CONFIRMED  |
| Total size                | 64 × 64 × 8 = 32 768 B | CONFIRMED (three samples) |
| Storage order             | Row-major (Z = row, X = column) | CONFIRMED |
| Tile size (world units)   | 16 × 16                 | CONFIRMED  |

Index formula (record byte offset from file start):

```
col            = floor(worldX / 16) & 0x3F
row            = floor(worldZ / 16) & 0x3F
record_offset  = (row × 64 + col) × 8
```

The `& 0x3F` mask (6-bit clamp to 0–63) is derived from the integer division and mask observed
in the index function.

### 6.2 Record layout — 8 bytes per tile

All fields are single bytes; endianness is not material.

| Offset | Size | Type  | Field           | Observed values      | Confidence | Notes |
|-------:|-----:|-------|-----------------|----------------------|------------|-------|
| 0      | 1    | u8    | `pad0`          | `0x00` only          | VERIFIED   | Always zero across all 3 samples (12 288 observations); no code reads this byte |
| 1      | 1    | u8    | `pad1`          | `0x00` only          | VERIFIED   | Always zero; no code reads this byte |
| 2      | 1    | u8    | `music_group`   | 0, 7                 | VERIFIED   | 1-based index into the per-area **background-music (BGM) sound table**. Value 0 = no music. Lookup is `table[index]`; entry stride is 48 bytes and the entry's first field is the playable sound resource handle |
| 3      | 1    | u8    | `ambient_idx_0` | 0, 2, 3, 16          | VERIFIED   | Index into the per-area **ambient-loop (BGE) sound table** (48-byte stride). First of two ambient slots. Value 0 = no sound. In samples this slot pairs consistently with the value 16 when active |
| 4      | 1    | u8    | `ambient_idx_1` | 0, 17                | VERIFIED   | Same ambient table as byte 3. Second ambient slot. Value 0 = no sound. Pairs with value 17 when active in samples |
| 5      | 1    | u8    | `effect_idx_0`  | 0, 57, 58, 91, 106   | VERIFIED   | Index into the per-area **event-effect (EFF) sound table** (48-byte stride). First of three effect slots. Value 0 = no sound |
| 6      | 1    | u8    | `effect_idx_1`  | 0, 91, 106           | VERIFIED   | Same EFF table as byte 5. Second effect slot. Value 0 = no sound. Non-zero values (91, 106) occur in samples, so this slot is genuinely used |
| 7      | 1    | u8    | `effect_idx_2`  | `0x00` only          | VERIFIED (limited) | Same EFF table. Third effect slot. The slot is read (the player loop runs three iterations) but is `0` in every sampled tile, so no non-zero value is yet observed |

**Sound tables referenced:** the position-driven ambient update reads exactly three of the
per-area sound tables — the BGM (music) table via byte 2, the BGE (ambient-loop) table via bytes
3–4, and the EFF (event-effect) table via bytes 5–7. Each table holds up to 256 entries at a
48-byte (0x30) stride; the first field of an entry is the playable sound resource handle and the
remaining entry fields are UNVERIFIED. Two further per-area sound tables exist (a walk table and a
run table) but are **not** indexed from the `.mud` grid in the analysed path — footstep sounds
appear to be driven by movement/animation events rather than per-tile lookup, which is the leading
explanation for why bytes 0–1 are unused (see §6.3).

### 6.3 Known unknowns

- `pad0` and `pad1` (bytes 0–1) purpose: always zero across all 12 288 sampled tiles and never
  read by the analysed ambient-update path. The leading hypothesis is that they are simply unused
  (a per-tile walkable-surface or footstep-sound flag that the movement system would have consumed
  was not found in the cell-lookup path; footstep audio appears event-driven). They could
  alternatively be reserved/version padding. PARTIAL — only zero values are available.
- `effect_idx_2` non-zero values: the loop slot exists but is zero in all samples.
- Maximum valid sound index (highest observed: 106 for `effect_idx_0`; theoretical maximum: 255).
- Whether row 0 corresponds to world-min-Z or world-max-Z (the index formula is confirmed, but
  the absolute Z orientation within a cell is not directly observable from binary layout alone).

## 7. Unknown extension — `.gad`

The `.gad` file is loaded as the third fixed per-cell asset, but the loader is a complete stub
that takes no action and returns success unconditionally. The format and purpose of `.gad` are
entirely UNKNOWN.

---

## 8. Building mesh blob — `.bud`

The `.bud` blob is the binary payload referenced by `DATAFILE` inside a `BUILDING` section. It
contains a variable-count list of mesh objects, each consisting of a vertex array and an index
list. The name "BUD" likely abbreviates "BUilDing" (the symbol prefix for all related
loader functions uses this three-letter prefix). There is no file-level magic or version field.

An authoring sidecar named `*.bud.pre` is a full standalone `.bud` file in this same layout but is
never read by the runtime — see §16.

**Note on byte alignment:** the `type` u8 at read-order 1 is not padded to 4 bytes. Fields begin
at whatever byte offset follows the preceding field.

### 8.3 Vertex record — 32 bytes (8 × f32le)

| Byte offset within vertex | Size | Type  | Field   | Notes                               | Confidence |

**Known unknowns for vertex bytes 12–31:** candidates are (Nx, Ny, Nz) packed normal plus (U, V)
texture coordinates, but the packing and whether any byte encodes alpha or material data is not
confirmed.

### 8.4 Known unknowns

- `type` field semantics: only value `0` observed; what other values exist and what they select.
- Vertex bytes 12–31: the five remaining f32le fields per vertex.

## 9. Upper-terrain / extended-detail blobs — `.up` and `.exd`

Both `.up` (referenced by `UP_TERRAIN` sections) and `.exd` (referenced by `EXTRA_TERRAIN`
sections — RESOLVED 2026-06-16, see §3.3) share a common binary structure: a count prefix followed
by an array of 40-byte triangle records, decoded by one shared record decoder. All coordinate fields
are world-space f32 values.

### 9.1 File layout

| Offset | Size                    | Type      | Field             | Notes                         | Confidence |

| 4      | `triangleCount × 40`    | record[]  | triangle array    | 40-byte records; see §9.2     | CONFIRMED  |

Total file size: `4 + triangleCount × 40`. Verified against three `.up` samples (all 484 bytes =
4 + 12 × 40) and three `.exd` samples (all 84 bytes = 4 + 2 × 40).

### 9.2 Triangle record — 40 bytes (10 × f32le)

| Byte offset | Size | Type  | Field   | Notes                                                        | Confidence |

| 36          | 4    | f32le | `extra` | In all available samples equals Y0 = Y1 = Y2 (planar triangles); may be a surface Y-level or material discriminator | PARTIAL |

All triangle vertex coordinates in samples fall within the expected cell world-space bounds.

**Known unknowns:** the `extra` field at byte 36 always equals the common Y height in these flat
samples; behaviour for non-planar triangles is unknown.

## 10. Special-effect layer blobs — `.fx1` through `.fx7`

Each FX section (`FX1`–`FX7`) has its own DATAFILE blob with the corresponding extension
(`.fx1`–`.fx7`). All blobs share a common outer structure, but the header size and vertex record
stride depend on a `typeId` field within the header.

### 10.0 FX-layer attachment wiring (CYCLE 1)

The `.fx1`..`.fx7` blobs **attach to the cell's render sub-manager slots 2..8 DURING the `.map` text
parse** — not in a later finalize pass. While the `.map` parser is scanning inside an `FXN { … }`
section and encounters the `DATAFILE` keyword, it reads the path token, opens that blob via the
VFS/disk open router, and decodes it straight into that section's dedicated sub-manager slot:
`FX1 → slot 2`, `FX2 → slot 3`, …, `FX7 → slot 8` (the cell's 9 render sub-manager slots are
slot 0 = ground texture-patch grid, slot 1 = building/object grid, slots 2..8 = fx1..fx7 — see
`structs/terrain-manager.md`). The matching `TEXTURES { idx texId }` sub-block in the same section
registers the per-layer texture indices onto the same slot. So **attachment = (the FX section + its
`DATAFILE` keyword) at parse time.** On any open/decode failure the parser logs a "cannot open" error
and aborts the whole cell load.

A **separate post-parse finalize pass** then walks the same 9 slots in order and **builds** each
already-attached blob into a usable per-cell grid. The build/finalize is distinct from the attach: it
does **not** open the file — it operates on data already attached during the parse. (This is the same
finalize pass that applies the `.ted` `idx − 1` decrement to slot 0, §5.6.) The adjacent
`EXTRA_TERRAIN` / `UP_TERRAIN` / `SOLID` sections target **separate** managers and are **not** part of
the 9-slot FX block. **Confidence: parser-verified (CYCLE 1, ida_anchor 263bd994).**

Authoring sidecars named `*.fx<N>.pre` are full standalone files in their corresponding base
`.fx<N>` format but are never read by the runtime — see §16 and `terrain_layers.md`.

### 10.1 Common outer structure

Every FX blob begins with a header whose first three u32le words are:

| Offset | Type  | Field            | Confidence |
|-------:|-------|------------------|------------|
| 0      | u32le | `objectCount`    | CONFIRMED  |
| 4      | u32le | `subObjectCount` | CONFIRMED  |
| 8      | u32le | padding (= 0)    | CONFIRMED  |

After the header: a flat vertex array followed immediately by a u16le index array (no separate
index-count prefix; `indexCount` is stored in the header). The vertex stride and header size
depend on `typeId`.

### 10.2 FX type 15 — `.fx1` and `.fx2`

Header is 24 bytes (6 × u32le):

| Offset | Type  | Field          | Confidence |
|-------:|-------|----------------|------------|
| 0      | u32le | `objectCount`  | CONFIRMED  |
| 4      | u32le | `subObjCount`  | CONFIRMED  |
| 8      | u32le | padding (= 0)  | CONFIRMED  |
| 12     | u32le | `typeId` (= 15)| CONFIRMED  |
| 16     | u32le | `vertexCount`  | CONFIRMED  |
| 20     | u32le | `indexCount`   | CONFIRMED  |

`.fx1` vertex record — 36 bytes (9 × f32le):

| Byte offset | Type  | Field   | Notes                           | Confidence |
|------------:|-------|---------|----------------------------------|------------|
| 0           | f32le | `X`     | World X                          | CONFIRMED  |
| 4           | f32le | `Y`     | World Y                          | CONFIRMED  |
| 8           | f32le | `Z`     | World Z                          | CONFIRMED  |
| 12          | f32le | `Nx`    | Normal X (value near ±1)         | CONFIRMED  |
| 16          | f32le | `Ny`    | Normal Y                         | CONFIRMED  |
| 20          | f32le | `Nz`    | Normal Z                         | CONFIRMED  |
| 24          | f32le | `unk6`  | Anomalous bit pattern in samples; may be a packed sentinel or alpha | UNVERIFIED |
| 28          | f32le | `U`     | Texture coordinate U             | PARTIAL    |
| 32          | f32le | `V`     | Texture coordinate V             | PARTIAL    |

`.fx2` vertex record — 44 bytes: same as `.fx1` with two additional f32le fields at bytes 36
and 40 (second UV set or lightmap UVs). PARTIAL confidence.

File size formula: `24 + vertexCount × stride + indexCount × 2`. Verified for both `.fx1` (stride
36, 3 verts, 3 indices → 138 bytes) and `.fx2` (stride 44, 3 verts, 3 indices → 162 bytes).

### 10.3 FX type 5 — `.fx3`

Header is 48 bytes (12 × u32le/f32le):

| Offset | Type  | Field          | Confidence |
|-------:|-------|----------------|------------|
| 0      | u32le | `objectCount`  | CONFIRMED  |
| 4      | u32le | `subObjCount`  | CONFIRMED  |
| 8      | u32le | padding        | CONFIRMED  |
| 12     | u32le | `typeId` (= 5) | CONFIRMED  |
| 16     | u32le | `unk4` (= 0)   | UNVERIFIED |
| 20     | f32le | `unk5` (= 1.0) | UNVERIFIED |
| 24     | u32le | `unk6` (= 0)   | UNVERIFIED |
| 28     | u32le | `unk7` (= 5)   | UNVERIFIED |
| 32     | u32le | `unk8` (= 5)   | UNVERIFIED |
| 36     | u32le | padding (= 0)  | CONFIRMED  |
| 40     | u32le | `vertexCount`  | CONFIRMED  |
| 44     | u32le | `indexCount`   | CONFIRMED  |

Vertex stride: 36 bytes (same layout as `.fx1`). File size formula: `48 + vertexCount × 36 +
indexCount × 2`. Verified (4 verts, 6 indices → 204 bytes).

### 10.4 Larger FX blobs — `.fx4`, `.fx5`, `.fx6`, `.fx7`

These blobs share the common outer structure but are more complex. Sizes are fully accounted for
`.fx5` and `.fx6`; header field semantics are UNVERIFIED for all four.

| Extension | Approx. size | Vertex stride | Notes                                                  | Confidence |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `.fx4`    | 1 076 B     | UNKNOWN       | Contains 2 top-level objects with 3 sub-objects; full decode incomplete | PARTIAL |
| `.fx5`    | 880 B       | 36            | 48-byte header similar to type 5; size fully accounted | PARTIAL |
| `.fx6`    | 29 444 B    | 32            | 40-byte header; `objectCount` field may be a grid dimension rather than a count | PARTIAL |
| `.fx7`    | 35 202 B    | UNKNOWN       | `objectCount` = 1; full decode incomplete              | PARTIAL |

**Note on `.fx6` vertex stride:** the 32-byte stride differs from the 36-byte stride used by
`.fx1`/`.fx3`. Whether this difference is driven by `typeId` or another header field is UNVERIFIED.

---

## 11. Collision solid blob — `.sod`

The `.sod` blob is the binary payload referenced by `DATAFILE` inside a `SOLID` section. It
encodes per-cell 2D collision geometry in the XZ world-space plane. All multi-byte fields are
little-endian. There is no file-level magic or version prefix.

The format is **strictly 2D**: collision testing is performed in the XZ plane; there is no Y
(height) component in the geometry. The runtime resolves containment purely from the explicit
corner geometry via a ray-parity point-in-polygon test (with AABB broad-phase) — it never lifts
any per-quad scalar into a 3D plane test (see §11.3 correction).

An authoring sidecar named `*.sod.pre` exists but is **never read by the runtime** and does **not**
share this 108-byte/48-byte runtime layout — see §16 and `terrain_layers.md`.

### 11.1 Top-level layout

```
File:
  u32le           solidCount
  SolidRecord[solidCount]          — fixed stride 108 bytes each
  — then, for each SolidRecord i in [0, solidCount):
  u32le           quadCount_i
  QuadRecord[quadCount_i]          — fixed stride 48 bytes each
```

The 48-byte record is the unit of collision geometry. The game code calls these records
"triangles" internally (and the per-solid count field "triCount"), but each on-disk record actually
stores **four XZ corner points** of a 2D quad plus four trailing scalars (see §11.3). This spec
calls them **collision quads** to avoid confusion with 3D triangle meshes.

**Important:** the per-solid `quadCount` u32le appears in the data stream **after** the entire flat
`SolidRecord` array, interleaved with its corresponding `QuadRecord` array. It is NOT embedded
before the matching `SolidRecord`. A redundant copy of the count is also stored inside the
`SolidRecord` at byte offset +060, but the parser reads the stream copy; the internal copy is
overwritten at runtime with a heap pointer.

File size formula (all three samples verified with zero remainder):

```
file_size = 4 + solidCount × (108 + 4 + quadCount × 48)
```

Worked sample sizes (zero remainder): a 1-solid / 4-quad cell is `4 + (108 + 4 + 4 × 48) = 308`
bytes; a 1-solid / 3-quad cell is `4 + (108 + 4 + 3 × 48) = 260` bytes. Both match their samples
exactly.

### 11.2 SolidRecord — 108 bytes (0x6C)

| Offset | Size | Type  | Field                      | Notes                                                                 | Confidence |

| +016   | 44   | —     | `_reserved_a`             | All zero on disk across every sample (including two cells with identical geometry under different map IDs, byte-for-byte equal). Not read by any analysed routine; purpose unknown | VERIFIED (all-zero) / UNVERIFIED (meaning) |
| +060   | 4    | u32le | `quad_count_embedded`     | Redundant copy of the per-solid quad count; parser reads the separate stream copy instead and overwrites this slot at runtime with the count it allocated | VERIFIED (equals stream count in all samples) |
| +064   | 4    | u32le | `_authoring_ptr`          | **Stale heap pointer left over from the authoring machine** — differs between cells, is a plausible 32-bit address, and is overwritten at load with the runtime pointer to the quad array. Carries no file-format meaning; a parser MUST ignore it | VERIFIED (stale pointer) |
| +068   | 40   | —     | `_reserved_b`             | All zero on disk in every sample; repurposed at runtime as a scratch/visited-frame cache (not file data) | VERIFIED (all-zero) / UNVERIFIED (meaning) |

### 11.3 QuadRecord — 48 bytes (0x30)

> slope-intercept *line segment* (`slope`/`intercept`/`lineKind` fields). Direct inspection of the

Each record stores one 2D collision quad in the XZ world-space plane as four corner points,
followed by four unused authoring scalars. There is no Y (height) component — collision is
evaluated in XZ at the solid's elevation. The runtime reconstructs all containment it needs from
the four corner points (ray-parity point-in-polygon); the trailing scalars are disregarded.

**Corner verification:** the four XZ corners of each sampled quad form a geometrically valid
rectangle whose min/max X and Z equal the owning `SolidRecord` AABB to within float rounding. This
was confirmed for all four quads of the 4-quad sample cell and all three quads of the 3-quad sample
cell — the corners are unambiguously world-space XZ positions, not line-equation parameters.

**Trailing scalars (+032..+047) — dead edge-line cache:** the layout is a precomputed 2D edge line
(a `z = m·x + c`-style parameterisation of one quad edge), left over from the authoring/export step.
**No runtime collision or quadtree routine reads any of these four scalars** — the maximum offset
any of them touches inside a QuadRecord is +028 (the last corner); in particular **no routine
sub-reads offset +036** (`edge_pad0`). A plane-equation interpretation would require a signed-distance
read of this region, and no such read exists. The values are also far outside unit-normal range,
ruling out a packed normal. The `edge_pad0`/`edge_pad1` lanes are not guaranteed zero on disk — the
VFS census shows `edge_pad0` non-zero in ~14.6 % of quads — but the runtime ignores them regardless,
so they are dead authoring residue. Treat +032..+047 as **disregarded authoring residue**: a parser
allocates the 48-byte stride but ignores these four floats. Confidence: HIGH that it is not a plane
equation; the no-read of `edge_pad0`/`edge_pad1` is CONFIRMED (loader-resolved); MODERATE on the
exact slope/intercept reading of `edge_slope`/`edge_intercept` (the value shape fits; no runtime read
ties it down).

**Terminology note:** the game code calls these records "triangles" (count field "triCount"). The
on-disk record is a four-corner XZ quad; this spec uses "quad" to avoid confusion with 3D triangle
meshes. Whether the runtime tests one quad or two split triangles per record — and how the diagonal
is chosen — is not confirmed.

### 11.4 Known unknowns for `.sod`

- `SolidRecord` bytes +016..+059 (`_reserved_a`, 44 bytes): always zero in all samples; purpose
  unknown. Could be padding or additional spatial metadata (for example a Y / height range) that
  only appears in files not present in the sample set.
- `SolidRecord` byte +064 (`_authoring_ptr`): identified as a stale authoring-machine heap pointer
  (overwritten at load); it carries no portable file meaning, but its 4-byte slot must still be
  skipped by a parser.
- `QuadRecord` trailing scalars +032..+047 (`edge_slope`/`edge_pad0`/`edge_intercept`/`edge_pad1`):
  RESOLVED that they are a **dead 2D edge-line cache, not a plane equation**, and are never read at
  runtime (§11.3). The `edge_pad0` lane at +036 is CONFIRMED opaque ignored padding (no routine
  sub-reads +036; ~14.6 % non-zero is dead authoring residue, not a clean lane). Only the exact
  authoring formula behind the slope/intercept pair (which edge it parameterises, sign convention)
  remains open — not recoverable from the runtime because the runtime never reads it, and not
  required to reproduce collision (use the corners).
- `QuadRecord` quad-to-triangle split: whether the runtime tests the four-corner quad directly or
  splits it into two triangles, and which diagonal it picks, is unknown.
- All available samples have `solidCount = 1`. Behaviour with multiple solids per cell is
  sample-unverified.

## 12. Cell streaming policy

### 12.1 Cell pool

The runtime maintains a fixed pool of **34 cell slots**. A cell slot is 24 712 bytes (0x6088).
The pool supports a maximum of 25 simultaneously active cells (5 × 5 ring), with the remaining
9 slots used as overflow or load buffers.

Each cell slot carries an **active flag** at byte offset 0x6084 within the slot:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `1`   | Cell is loaded and active |
| `0`   | Slot is free or marked evictable |

### 12.2 Quality-dependent stream radii

The streaming ring radius is selected at startup based on a client quality setting:

| Quality level | Stream radius (world units) | Ring shape | Ring-radius cells |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| High (1)      | 1 800.0                     | 5 × 5     | 5                  |
| Medium (2)    | 1 000.0                     | 3 × 3     | 4                  |
| Low (other)   | 600.0                       | 3 × 3     | 4                  |

The ring shape (5 × 5 vs. 3 × 3) is determined at runtime by comparing the stored stream radius
to 1 000.0: if greater, the 5 × 5 ring dispatcher is used; otherwise the 3 × 3 dispatcher.

### 12.3 Eviction policy

When the player moves to a new centre cell, every loaded cell whose distance from the new centre
exceeds **2 cells** in either the X or Z axis is marked evictable (active flag set to 0). The
eviction threshold is strictly `> 2` (cells exactly 2 away are retained). Reuse of an evictable
slot is handled by the background streaming thread on its next scheduling cycle.

### 12.4 Per-frame update constraint

The per-frame ring-shift logic asserts that the player cannot move more than **one cell** in
either axis between consecutive frames. A delta greater than 1 triggers an assertion failure
(confirmed via source-filename string `terrainmanager.cpp`, line 443).

### 12.5 Background thread schedule

A single background worker thread handles asynchronous cell loads. Its schedule is:

| Wake event                  | Delay    |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| First wake after start      | 4 000 ms |
| Subsequent polling interval | 3 000 ms |

Load requests are enqueued as `{mapX, mapZ, areaId}` triples in a FIFO queue. A separate
synchronous load path exists for immediate-priority requests and is protected by a mutex shared
with the background thread.

## 13. Key cell object field layout (for completeness; not a binary file format)

This section documents select byte offsets within the in-memory cell object, included because
`Assets.Parsers` populates these fields after loading the binary assets. All offsets are byte
offsets from the start of the cell object allocation.

## 14. Known unknowns (priority list for further analysis)

The following items remain unverified and represent the highest-risk unknowns for implementors:

1. **EXTRA_TERRAIN DATAFILE extension:** RESOLVED (2026-06-16, two-witness) — `EXTRA_TERRAIN` targets
   `.exd` blobs, decoded by the `.exd`/`.up` 40-byte-triangle decoder, **not** the `.ted` five-block
   loader (§3.2/§3.3). The located runtime `.map` parser dispatches the `EXTRA_TERRAIN` `DATAFILE` to
   the triangle decoder; no longer an open question.

2. **`.ted` block 3 reference target:** RESOLVED — the 1-based texture index resolves first into
   the per-cell `TEXTURES{}` list (`idx − 1`), then into the global `bgtexture.lst` pool (§5.6).
   **Loader vs finalize domain (RESOLVED CYCLE 1, ida_anchor 263bd994):** the `.ted` loader stores
   the byte RAW; the `idx − 1` decrement and the `[1, count]` clamp are applied once by the
   **per-cell texture finalize routine** (a fixed, statically isolable code site in the
   map/cell-descriptor finalize path — no longer DBG-pending). The outcome is settled (tile uses
   `texlist[byte − 1]`; a byte `< 1` or `> count` floors to slot 1; the "0 = no-texture sentinel"
   reading is REFUTED). The `− 1` is on the `.ted` byte ONLY; the `.map` `intTexId` is stored raw and
   the pool accessors apply no `− 1`. A faithful parser stores the raw byte and does NOT decrement/clamp.

3. **`.ted` block 4 bit-to-geometry mapping:** RESOLVED for texture orientation — bit `0x01`
   mirrors S (U), bit `0x02` mirrors T (V) (§5.7). Remaining sub-question (PARTIAL): whether a flip
   combination also re-selects the quad triangulation diagonal versus only re-orienting the texture.

4. **`.ted` block 5 alpha and 2× encoding:** Alpha byte RESOLVED — it is 4-byte alignment padding,
   always 0, never read (§5.8). The 2× store / 0.5× load scaling is code-confirmed; it stays
   sample-unverified until a tinted tile is captured.

5. **`.bud` vertex bytes 12–31:** The five f32le values per vertex beyond XYZ are unconfirmed.

6. **`.up`/`.exd` `extra` field (byte 36):** Always equals the common Y for flat triangles.
   Behaviour for non-planar geometry is unknown.

7. **`.sod` `SolidRecord` bytes +016..+059:** Always zero in single-solid samples; purpose may
   become apparent in files with `solidCount > 1`.

8. **`.sod` `QuadRecord` trailing scalars (+032..+047):** RESOLVED — they are a **dead 2D edge-line
   cache, not a plane equation**, and are never read at runtime (§11.3). The `edge_pad0` lane at
   +036 is CONFIRMED opaque ignored padding (no routine sub-reads +036; the ~14.6 % non-zero is
   dead authoring residue). Collision is reproduced from the four explicit corners; the exact
   authoring formula behind the slope/intercept pair is out of scope (the original editor is not in
   the binary).

9. **`.gad` format:** Loader is a no-op stub; purpose and format entirely unknown.

10. **`.bgtexture.lst` GHTex record layout (76 bytes):** Only the stride is confirmed.

11. **`.mud` `pad0`/`pad1` purpose:** Always zero with no observed read in available samples.

  **CAMPAIGN VFS-MASTERY** by a **two-witness gate** (legacy loader read-path + black-box VFS
  census); the prior "0 = no-texture sentinel" reading is REFUTED. The 2026-06-16 reconcile pass
  (**CAMPAIGN VFS-MASTERY-B**, same two-witness method over all 2 505 `.ted` instances) **corrected
  the domain** of the block-3 `idx − 1` decrement and value-0 clamp: the `.ted` loader stores the
  byte RAW. **CYCLE 1 (2026-06-19, ida_anchor 263bd994) RESOLVED the decrement site statically:** the
  `idx − 1` and the `[1, count]` clamp are applied once by the per-cell texture finalize routine (a
  fixed code site, not draw-time / DBG-pending); the `− 1` is on the `.ted` byte only.

## 16. Authoring/editor sidecars — `.pre` and `.post` families (runtime never parses)

This section consolidates the two per-cell file families that exist in the VFS purely as
**authoring / content-pipeline / editor sidecars**. **The shipped runtime client never opens
either family**, so `Assets.Parsers` needs **no parser** for them. They are documented for
preservation and tooling only.

> A standalone consolidated index of both families — with the deep-pass `.sod.pre` lean
> multi-polygon layout (848 files) and the `.fx<N>.pre` extended-record findings — lives in
> `Docs/RE/formats/authoring_sidecars.md`. Cite that file when documenting why a `.pre`/`.post`
> extension is skipped.

The decisive evidence is the same for both: the `.map` `DATAFILE` line always names a **base**
extension (§3.2), the literal strings `.pre` and `.post` do not drive any runtime load path, and
the VFS open router does no extension rewriting / fallback / base-pre-post selection. The runtime
load path therefore always resolves to the base asset, never to a sidecar.

### 16.1 `.post` family — full drop-in `.ted` (editor workspace copy)

Covered in detail in §5.10. Summary: `*.ted.post` is a byte-identical 46 987-byte `.ted` written
by the in-game terrain editor; 852 instances in the VFS, all the same fixed size; runtime never
reads it. Confidence: HIGH.

### 16.2 `.pre` family — full standalone files in their base format

A `.pre` file is a **complete, self-contained copy of an asset in the same on-disk format as the
base extension named before `.pre`** — for example a `*.bud.pre` is a complete `.bud`, a
`*.sod.pre` is a `.sod`-family file, a `*.fx<N>.pre` is a complete `.fx<N>`. It holds a different
*version* of the same scene/object set (e.g. vertex coordinates nudged), parsed start-to-finish by
the same sequential count-prefixed reader as the base format. **There is no offset+length+
replacement-byte patch grammar — `.pre` is a full file, not a delta.** It appears to be a
pre-processed / source capture kept beside the shipped base file during the build pipeline.

**Confidence: HIGH** that `.pre` is a full standalone file the runtime never consumes (the literal
`.pre` is absent from the binary; no routine constructs or opens a `.pre` filename; the `.map`
references base extensions only; a sampled `.bud.pre` shares the base `.bud` header and record
layout, differing only slightly in float values — a re-saved variant, not a patch).

**VFS census (full mount, 43 347 entries):** 2 014 `.pre` files by embedded base extension —
`.sod` 848, `.bud` 757, `.fx2` 170, `.fx1` 127, `.fx3` 82, `.fx5` 29, `.fx7` 1 (no `.fx4`/`.fx6`
`.pre` observed). Sizes range from tiny (a 40-byte `.sod.pre`, a 195-byte `.bud.pre`) to 800 KB+,
consistent with full files of varying content, not fixed-size patch headers. No compression or
encryption; raw little-endian, identical in shape to the base format.

| Sidecar           | Internal layout                                                                 | Confidence |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `*.bud.pre`       | Full `.bud` (see §8): `u32 objectCount` then packed MassObject records          | HIGH (sample header/first-record match base `.bud`) |
| `*.fx<N>.pre`     | Full `.fx<N>` (see §10 and `terrain_layers.md`); not byte-inspected this pass    | UNVERIFIED (expected full base format) |
| `*.sod.pre`       | **Does NOT match the runtime `.sod` 108/48-byte layout** — see nuance below      | SAMPLE-only / NOT runtime-parsed |

**`.sod.pre` nuance (flagged):** the inspected `.sod.pre` sample does **not** use the runtime
`.sod` 108-byte SolidRecord + 48-byte QuadRecord layout of §11. A 40-byte sample reads as
`u32 = 1`, `u32 = 4`, then four XZ float pairs — a single 4-vertex polygon, i.e. a leaner
polygon-list representation. Two readings, both consistent with the verdict: (a) `.sod.pre` is a
*source* polygon list the build step expands into the shipped 108-byte-record `.sod`, or (b) an
older/alternate `.sod` schema. Either way it is a **full standalone file, not a patch**, and since
the runtime never opens `.pre`, this representation difference does not affect the shipped client.
The `.sod.pre` internal layout is marked **SAMPLE-only / NOT runtime-parsed**; do not implement a
runtime reader for it. (The detailed `.sod.pre` field table lives in `terrain_layers.md` §4.)

**Engineering takeaway:** neither `.pre` nor `.post` requires a runtime parser. An engineer wiring
`Assets.Parsers` resolves every per-cell asset through the base extension named in the `.map`
`DATAFILE` line and ignores `.pre`/`.post` entirely. Cite `// spec: Docs/RE/formats/terrain.md`
(§16) when documenting why these extensions are skipped.

**Known unknowns (`.pre`):** the exact authoring-pipeline semantics (is `.pre` the source the build
consumes, or a backup of a prior version?) is not recoverable from the client binary (the producer
is a content tool not present in it); `.fx<N>.pre` internal bytes were not dumped this pass
(expected full base format); the `.sod.pre` lean-polygon layout vs. runtime `.sod` (whether source
or older schema) is SAMPLE-only.
