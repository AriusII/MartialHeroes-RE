# RE Provenance Journal

Append-only log of reverse-engineering sessions. Each entry documents *what* was analyzed and
*which neutral specs* resulted — the audit trail backing the EU Art. 6 "analysis performed solely
to achieve interoperability" claim. **Never paste decompiler output here.**

Entry format (append newest at the bottom; the `re-session-log` skill automates this):

## 2026-06-11 — protocol-spec-author
- binary: Main.exe (doida.exe build referenced in dirty notes)
- tool: none (firewall bridge — no IDA; rewrote neutral analyst notes only)
- analyzed (by canonical name): WireCipher, WireCompression, SecureHandshake, ConfigCryptoApi
- specs produced/updated:
  - Docs/RE/specs/crypto.md (new)
  - Docs/RE/names.yaml (crypto: block populated; opcode handshake note)
- notes: Promoted the dirty-room cryptography findings into one clean spec. Documented that the
  8-byte frame header is always plaintext and that payload transforms live at the message tier,
  not the socket/framing layer; header-only packets (length 8) bypass all transforms. Described the
  outbound pipeline as plaintext payload -> keyless/stateless byte cipher (3 rounds, each a forward
  then backward sweep with per-sweep feedback accumulator, position mixing, direction-specific
  rotations and two whitening constants) -> LZ4 compression. Stated explicitly the cipher takes no
  seed/key and that the major:minor opcode is not a cipher seed. Flagged prominently the #1 open
  question: the client receive path only LZ4-decompresses and applies no inverse cipher, implying
  server->client payloads may be compressed-only; marked capture_verified: false pending a live
  capture check. Documented the separate opcode 0/0 bignum public-key session handshake (server
  modulus + exponent + token; client modular-exp reply as Auth 1/4 with light per-dword XOR
  whitening) and that it does not key the wire cipher. Scoped out the ADVAPI32 CryptoAPI cluster as
  anti-cheat + signed-config loader. Listed the numeric constants still to recover (round count,
  per-sweep rotation amounts, whitening bytes, position-counter derivation, LZ4 variant, handshake
  XOR key and field layout) under a Recovery TODO; no values invented. No code or addresses copied.

## 2026-06-11 - protocol-spec-author
- binary: Main.exe (legacy client; analysis pinned to the dirty-room note set)
- tool: none (clean-room promotion only; no IDA, no decompiler access)
- analyzed: promoted dirty-room protocol findings into committed neutral specs. Frame header
  (8-byte, LE: size u16, major u16, minor u16, payload from +8); the (major:minor) pair is the
  opcode; no sequence number, no checksum, no socket-layer cipher; some frames LZ4-compressed and
  expanded before dispatch. Catalogued 182 opcodes across families 0=KeyExchange, 1=ServerCommand,
  2=GameAction (C2S), 3=CharacterMgmt, 4=Response, 5=Push. Applied the 4/13 naming correction
  (Response LocalPlayerStateSync; ignored the stale 5-100 suffix). Promoted the Actor +
  SpawnDescriptor entity layout (positions are float, not fixed-point; Y often 0).
- specs produced/updated: Docs/RE/opcodes.md (182-row catalog + frame-header spec);
  Docs/RE/packets/0-0_key_exchange.yaml, 2-52_use_skill.yaml, 3-1_character_list.yaml,
  3-5_enter_game_response.yaml, 5-0_char_despawn.yaml, 5-3_char_spawn.yaml, 5-7_chat_broadcast.yaml,
  5-13_actor_movement_update.yaml, 5-52_actor_skill_action.yaml; Docs/RE/structs/actor.md;
  Docs/RE/names.yaml (opcodes block, 182 entries).
- notes: All field layouts are static inferences - NO live capture was available, so every packet
  spec is tagged status: hypothesis / capture_verified: false and lists its open unknowns. Catalog
  passes the opcode-catalog validator (0 warnings); fixed-size specs (5/0=12, 3/5=44, 5/13=40,
  5/3=908) verified to sum to their declared size via the packet-codegen generator. The 2/52
  C2S spec is explicitly incomplete (send-site not analyzed) and must not be implemented as-is.

## 2026-06-11 — dirty-room RE sessions (re-static / re-protocol / re-crypto / re-asset-format / re-struct-cartographer)
- binary: doida.exe @ 63fcaf8e (x86 32-bit, imagebase 0x400000)
- tool: IDA Pro 9.3 via MCP (mcp__ida__*), read-only (no IDB modification)
- analyzed (by canonical subsystem): overlapped Winsock receive loop and the (major:minor) message-tier
  dispatch architecture; the message-tier wire cipher + LZ4 stage and the bignum session handshake;
  the memory-mapped VFS archive (data.inf index + data/data.vfs blob) and the .xobj/.skn/.bnd geometry
  + texture load paths; the Actor/entity object and embedded SpawnDescriptor layout.
- specs produced/updated: none directly — all raw findings were written to the gitignored
  Docs/RE/_dirty/ quarantine, then rewritten into clean specs by the spec-author entries here.
- notes: Foundation interoperability analysis of the legacy client. No pseudo-code recorded anywhere;
  address-tagged raw findings live ONLY under _dirty/ and are never committed. The re_provenance_logger
  hook captured per-call digests under .claude/hooks/state/.

## 2026-06-11 — asset-spec-author
- binary: doida.exe @ 63fcaf8e
- tool: none (firewall bridge — no IDA; rewrote neutral analyst notes only)
- analyzed (by canonical name): VfsHeader, VfsEntry (data.inf index + data/data.vfs blob); .xobj / .skn /
  .bnd geometry; texture container.
- specs produced/updated:
  - Docs/RE/formats/pak.md (new) — 24-byte index header (entry_count @ +12 CONFIRMED), 144-byte TOC
    record (name[100], dataOffset i64 @ +104, dataSize i64 @ +112), binary-search lookup; no compression
    or encryption on the read path.
  - Docs/RE/formats/mesh.md (new) — .xobj (ASCII static), .skn (binary skinned: 36B faces, 24B verts
    normal-before-position, 12B weights), .bnd (72B bones).
  - Docs/RE/formats/texture.md (new) — no proprietary format; raw bytes handed to D3DX; inbound is not
    JPEG (ijl is export-only); DDS/TGA likely, sample-unverified.
- notes: All field layouts derived from the parser routines only; no archive/asset sample was available,
  so the five unconsumed index dwords and the trailing TOC padding are flagged UNVERIFIED. Promotion of
  the dirty-room asset-format notes; no decompiler output or addresses crossed the firewall.

## 2026-06-11 — protocol-spec-author
- binary: doida.exe @ 63fcaf8e (analysis pinned to the dirty-room note set; no IDA this session)
- tool: none (firewall bridge — no IDA; rewrote a neutral analyst note only)
- analyzed (by canonical name): WireCipher, WireCompression, SecureHandshake
- specs produced/updated: Docs/RE/specs/crypto.md
- notes: Promoted the now-recovered wire-cipher numeric constants from the neutral dirty-room note
  into the clean crypto spec, replacing the former Recovery TODO placeholders with a pinned
  constants table and weaving the values into the algorithm so Network.Crypto can implement a
  round-tripping cipher. Pinned: round count R=3; forward sweep rotate-left 3, add the
  remaining-length counter, XOR the feedback accumulator, then rotate-right 1 with one's-complement
  plus 0x48 (equivalently 71 minus that rotated value); backward sweep rotate-left 4, add the
  counter, XOR feedback, then XOR 0x13 and rotate-right 3. Called out as load-bearing that the
  position counter is a remaining-length countdown initialized to the payload length and decremented
  per byte (8-bit), NOT the forward index, and that the feedback accumulator is a one-byte value
  reset to zero at each sweep start. Gave the algebraic inverse for decrypt. Pinned LZ4 as stock
  raw-block (no frame header/magic/checksum), acceleration 1, inbound max decompressed size 11680
  with length carried by the 8-byte header. Pinned the 1/4 handshake reply whitening: XOR key 0x29,
  selector 0x40, complement test (selector & key & 0x1F)==1 evaluating false so the key is used
  as-is; whitened span is the whole dword-aligned payload — corrected the earlier note that 0x40
  was a length (it is the selector). Pinned the handshake field layout: 0/0 server->client is a
  54-byte key blob plus two 4-byte scalars (62 bytes), blob is two 2-byte headers then [u32 len]
  [digits] twice (modulus then exponent), little-endian lengths, constraint L1+L2=42; reply uses
  PKCS#1 v1.5 block-type-2 padding with padded block = modulus_bytes-1 and body [u32 len][digits].
  Kept flagged as unresolved/capture-dependent: the exact L1/L2 split (server wire data), the bit
  meaning of the two 2-byte per-bignum headers, and whether an inbound decrypt exists (structurally
  absent, capture-unverified). Spec stays capture_verified: false. No pseudo-code or addresses copied.

## 2026-06-11 — dirty-room RE expansion wave (re-protocol / re-struct-cartographer / re-asset-format / re-crypto)
- binary: doida.exe @ 63fcaf8e (x86 32-bit), IDA Pro 9.3 via MCP, read-only (no IDB modification)
- analyzed (by canonical subsystem): the 105 outbound C2S build-sites (Net_SendPacket) — MoveRequest 2/13,
  UseSkill 2/52 send-site, EnterGameRequest 1/9, Auth/Login 1/4 & 1/6, chat 2/7 & 2/83 & 3/21 — plus
  expanded S2C layouts (5/53 vitals, 5/1 spawn-extended, 5/32 level-up, 4/29 stat-update, 3/1 full slot
  record); the max-HP/MP vitals formula and per-stat composition; the full 880-byte SpawnDescriptor,
  the item and skill structs; the asset UNVERIFIED fields (data.inf header dwords, LenStr width,
  .bnd bone record, texture container); and the session handshake reply construction.
- specs produced/updated (promoted by the spec-author entries that follow, all neutral, capture_verified: false):
  Docs/RE/opcodes.md (189 rows; C2S opcodes added), Docs/RE/packets/*.yaml (10 new/expanded),
  Docs/RE/structs/{stats,spawn_descriptor,item,skill}.md, Docs/RE/specs/crypto.md (§6 handshake reply),
  Docs/RE/formats/{pak,mesh,texture}.md (mesh corrections: LenStr u32, .bnd 36-byte record), names.yaml (C2S opcodes).
- notes: All findings written to the gitignored Docs/RE/_dirty/ quarantine first, then rewritten into the
  clean specs. No pseudo-code or addresses crossed the firewall. Two corrections to already-written
  Assets.Parsers code surfaced (LenStr 4-byte prefix; .bnd 36-byte on-disk record). Handshake reply build,
  cipher constants, and the stat formula are statically pinned; concrete server values (RSA n/e, L1/L2 split,
  level/server stat bases) and field semantics remain capture/catalog-dependent.
