# RE Provenance Journal

Append-only log of reverse-engineering sessions. Each entry documents *what* was analyzed and
*which neutral specs* resulted — the audit trail backing the EU Art. 6 "analysis performed solely
to achieve interoperability" claim. **Never paste decompiler output here.**

Entry format (append newest at the bottom; the `re-session-log` skill automates this):

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <analyst>
- binary: Main.exe @ <sha256 prefix>
- tool: IDA Pro 9.3 via MCP (mcp__ida__*)
- analyzed: <functions / opcodes / structs touched, by canonical name>
- specs produced/updated: <committed paths under Docs/RE/>
- notes: <plain-language summary, no pseudo-code>
```
